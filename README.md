% Etch a Sketch

This is a project from the Odin Project Course, where we are challenged to create an etch-a-sketch like webpage in which the user can interact with to draw. The focus of this project is mainly to practice DOM manipulation, using javascript in conjunction with HTML to create and update the "canvas" and allow the user to interact with other elements. The page also has some CSS styling.
